An infinite loop is a programmer’s worst nightmare.Bugs are not errors; they are unexpected features.Good documentation saves lives (or at least hours of frustration).Programming is thinking, not typing.Merge conflicts are a way of life.Programming is like solving puzzles all day, every day.Nothing is impossible, except estimating project timelines accurately.Good documentation saves lives (or at least hours of frustration).Programming is just Googling the same thing over and over again.If your code works the first time, check again.Refactoring: because nothing is perfect.Pushing to production on a Friday should be illegal.Errors are just opportunities to learn.The best part of coding is watching it work.Errors are just opportunities to learn.Hello world is where it all begins.A bad day coding is better than a good day doing paperwork.Naming variables is harder than coding.Git commit -am "WTF is this?"The best way to debug is to explain your code to a rubber duck.Console.log(“Hello, debugging!”);Code like you care.Sometimes, the best debugging technique is to walk away.Fix one bug, introduce two more.When in doubt, refactor.Code like you care.Software development is 90% Googling and 10% typing.Programming is just writing instructions for a very dumb computer.Git commit -am "WTF is this?"alts.txt
