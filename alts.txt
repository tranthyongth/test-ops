Programming is the closest thing we have to magic.A true programmer never blames the compiler.Just because it compiles doesn’t mean it works.Documentation is a love letter to your future self.The first step in optimization is not to do it.The cloud is just someone else’s downtime.If it works, don’t touch it.If (code == ugly) { refactor(); }My code works… I have no idea why.A day of debugging can save you an hour of planning.There is no cloud, just someone else’s computer.The best debugging tool is a good night's sleep.A programmer is a machine that turns coffee into code.Commit often, push regularly, and hope for the best.Real programmers count from 0.Software developers are the only people who can make something out of nothing… and still break it.The best way to debug is to explain your code to a rubber duck.The best feature is the one you don’t have to maintain.Comment your code like you’ll never see it again.Talk is cheap. Show me the code.AI won’t take your job, but another programmer will.Code is read more often than it is written.Programming is the closest thing we have to magic.Sometimes, the best debugging technique is to walk away.Keep calm and write Python.No code is better than bad code.Sometimes, the best debugging technique is to walk away.Keep calm and write Python.Code without purpose is just wasted keystrokes.Nothing is impossible, except estimating project timelines accurately.One does not simply write good commit messages."It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!"If your code works the first time, check again.Hello, world!Keyboard not responding. Press F1 to continue.Console.log(“Hello, debugging!”);An infinite loop is a programmer’s worst nightmare.Merge conflicts are a way of life.Errors are just opportunities to learn.If it ain’t broke, improve it until it is."It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!"If you like debugging, you’ll love JavaScript.The fastest way to fix a bug is to introduce a new one.Programming is just Googling the same thing over and over again.Write tests like your life depends on them.The best code is no code at all.A codebase is a garden; it requires constant maintenance.Without tests, it’s not a bug, it’s an undocumented feature."To-do" comments will never be done.The best code is no code at all.Code is read more often than it is written.If software was easy, everyone would do it.Keep calm and write Python.Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don’t C#.Write code that even your grandma can understand.With great power comes great responsibility… to write unit tests.AI won’t take your job, but another programmer will.Trust the process, but verify the output.The best way to debug is to explain your code to a rubber duck.Fix one bug, introduce two more.Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.A programmer’s life: Eat, Sleep, Code, Repeat.Git happens.An infinite loop is a programmer’s worst nightmare.Bugs are not errors; they are unexpected features.Good documentation saves lives (or at least hours of frustration).Programming is thinking, not typing.Merge conflicts are a way of life.Programming is like solving puzzles all day, every day.Nothing is impossible, except estimating project timelines accurately.Good documentation saves lives (or at least hours of frustration).Programming is just Googling the same thing over and over again.If your code works the first time, check again.Refactoring: because nothing is perfect.Pushing to production on a Friday should be illegal.Errors are just opportunities to learn.The best part of coding is watching it work.Errors are just opportunities to learn.Hello world is where it all begins.A bad day coding is better than a good day doing paperwork.Naming variables is harder than coding.Git commit -am "WTF is this?"The best way to debug is to explain your code to a rubber duck.Console.log(“Hello, debugging!”);Code like you care.Sometimes, the best debugging technique is to walk away.Fix one bug, introduce two more.When in doubt, refactor.Code like you care.Software development is 90% Googling and 10% typing.Programming is just writing instructions for a very dumb computer.Git commit -am "WTF is this?"alts.txt
